As a physicist and materials scientist, my goal is to understand fundamental structure-function relationships in mineralized tissues such as bones, teeth, ivory, while also addressing applied biomedical or archaeological questions.

My research consists in developing new imaging methods, analytical tools and concepts to decipher the functional impact of the material’s nanostructure, multiscale hierarchy, disorder, interfaces and structural gradients of the tissue, on one side, and of the cellular network topology and multiscale porosity on the other.

My main expertise is in synchrotron X-ray imaging and analysis with scattering contrast (SAXS, WAXS, XRD), fluorescence optical microscopy and non-linear imaging methods (two-photon, second and third-harmonic generation) and analytical methods related to the physics of complex systems. One specificityis that we work on the whole chain from advanced sample preparation, instrument development, to scientific analysis.

My position at CNRS allows me to focus 100 % on research and related activities, but I also teach various courses (see corresponding sections for more info).
