This project started in 2012 in collaboration with [Prof. Elsa Vennat](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=fr&user=8wSkWpsAAAAJ) from [CentraleSup√©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), [University Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), France.

 **Keywords:** _Tooth dentin, cellular porosity, odontoblasts, sentivity, biomechanics_.

The aim is to characterize dentinal porosity at the whole tooth level and understand its biomechanical impact and role in sensitivy.
