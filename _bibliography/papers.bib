	abstract = {A model describing the size and arrangement of mineral particles in bone tissues is used to analyse the results of a scanning small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiment on a pathological bone biopsy. The overall description assumes that the nanometre-sized mineral platelets are arranged in a parallel fashion with possible fluctuations in their relative position, orientation and thickness. This method is tested on a thin sample section obtained from the biopsy of an osteoporotic patient treated with a high cumulative dose of NaF. The mineralization pattern of fluorotic bone is known to exhibit significant differences as compared to healthy bone in terms of density, particle size and organization. This is the first attempt to provide quantitative indicators of the degree of regularity in the packing of the mineral platelets in human pathological bone. Using scanning SAXS with a synchrotron microbeam of 15µm allows discrimination between pathological and healthy bone at the tissue level. Additionally, the benefits of this method are discussed with respect to the accuracy of particle size determination using SAXS.},

	abstract = {A characteristic feature of the dense phases formed by ﬁber-shaped molecules is their organization into parallel rods packed in a hexagonal or pseudo-hexagonal lateral network. This is typically the case for the collagen triple helices inside ﬁbrils, as conﬁrmed by recent X-ray diffraction experiments carried out on highly crystallized ﬁbers obtained by immersing the freshly extracted ﬁbers in a salt-controlled medium. However such diffraction patterns also generally exhibit additional features in the form of diffuse scattering, which is a clear signature of a low degree of lateral ordering. Only few studies have analyzed and modeled the lateral packing of collagen triple helices when the structure is disordered. Some authors have used the concept of short-range order but this approach does not contain any echo of a hexagonal order. In this study, we use an analytical expression derived from the paracrystal model which retains the hexagonal symmetry information and leads to a good agreement with the experimental data in the medium-angle region. This method is quite sensitive to the degree of disorder and to the inter-object distance. One clear result is that the shift in peak positions, generally attributed to variations in intermolecular distances, can also arise from a change in the degree of ordering without any signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the distances. This underlines the importance of evaluating the degree of ordering before attributing a shift in peak position to a change in the unit-cell. This method is generic and can be applied to any system composed of rod-shaped molecules.},

	abstract = {The elastic properties of bone tissue determine the biomechanical behavior of bone at the organ level. It is now widely accepted that the nanoscale structure of bone plays an important role to determine the elastic properties at the tissue level. Hence, in addition to the mineral density, the structure and organization of the mineral nanoparticles and of the collagen microfibrils appear as potential key factors governing the elasticity. Many studies exist on the role of the organization of collagen microfibril and mineral nanocrystals in strongly remodeled bone. However, there is no direct experimental proof to support the theoretical calculations. Here, we provide such evidence through a novel approach combining several high resolution imaging techniques: scanning acoustic microscopy, quantitative scanning small-Angle X-ray scattering imaging and synchrotron radiation computed microtomography. We find that the periodic modulations of elasticity across osteonal bone are essentially determined by the orientation of the mineral nanoparticles and to a lesser extent only by the particle size and density. Based on the strong correlation between the orientation of the mineral nanoparticles and the collagen molecules, we conclude that the microfibril orientation is the main determinant of the observed undulations of microelastic properties in regions of constant mineralization in osteonal lamellar bone. This multimodal approach could be applied to a much broader range of fibrous biological materials for the purpose of biomimetic technologies.},

	abstract = {Three elephant tusks recovered from a 18th century Dutch shipwreck in Brittany seawaters were analyzed to study early diagenetic changes of ivory in a marine environment. Micro-small angle X-ray scattering (μSAXS) analysis revealed sub-microscopic structural modiﬁcations of ivory (hydroxyapatite particle thickness, mineralized collagen ﬁbers organization and orientation). Chemical compositional changes of the organic fraction (nitrogen and carbon loss) and of the mineral part (magnesium loss, carbonate, calcium, chlorine and strontium uptake) were investigated by non-invasive micro-Particle Induced X-ray Emission/Gamma-ray Emission/Rutherford and Elastic Backscattering Spectrometry analysis (μPIXE/PIGE/RBS/EBS). These chemical and structural markers can serve as proxies for the early diagenesis of elephant tusk in marine settings. The results show that the macroscopic preservation state of the tusk surface does not reﬂect its microscopic preservation state. A diagenetic sequence is proposed, depending on the local environment of each tusk. First, collagen hydrolysis and ion adsorptions from the marine environment are proposed to occur. Second, a tusk buried in the sand was protected from Ca enrichment of the surface and the formation of a ﬂaky white concretion whereas tusks out of the sand were subjected to these latter phenomena as well as sea-urchin attacks. Third, ion leaching and uptake, increased crystallinity of the hydroxyapatite crystals, and the modiﬁcations of the mineralized collagen ﬁber network are assumed to happen for all three tusks with different level of completion.},

	abstract = {Macroscopic, periodic, dark and bright patterns are observed on sections of elephant tusk, in the dentin part (ivory). The motifs—also called Schreger pattern—vary depending on the orientation in the tusk: on sections perpendicular to the tusk axis, a checkerboard pattern is present whereas on sections longitudinal to it, alternating stripes are observed. This pattern has been used to identify elephant and mammoth ivory in archeological artifacts and informs on the continuous tissue growth mechanisms of tusk. However, its origin, assumed to be related to the 3D structure of empty microtubules surrounded by the ivory matrix has yet to be characterized unequivocally. Based on 2D observations of the ivory microtubules by means of a variety of imaging techniques of three different planes (transverse, longitudinal and tangential to the tusk axis), we show that the dark areas of the macroscopic pattern are due to tubules oblique to the surface whereas bright areas are related to tubules parallel to it. The different microstructures observed in the three planes as well as the 3D data obtained by SR-μCT analysis allow us to propose a 3D model of the microtubule network with helical tubules phase-shifted in the tangential direction. The phase shift is a combination of a continuous phase shift of π every 1 mm with a stepwise phase shift of π/2 every 500 μm. By using 3D modeling, we show how the 3D helical model better represents the experimental microstructure observed in 2D planes compared to previous models in the literature. This brings new information on the origin of the unique Schreger pattern of elephant ivory, crucial for better understanding how archaeological objects were processed and for opening new routes to rethink how biological materials are built.},

            Interfaces provide the structural basis of essential bone functions. In the hierarchical structure of bone tissue, heterogeneities such as porosity or boundaries are found at scales ranging from nanometers to millimeters, all of which contributing to macroscopic properties. To date, however, the complexity or limitations of currently used imaging methods restrict our understanding of this functional integration. Here we address this issue using label-free third-harmonic generation (THG) microscopy. We find that the porous lacuno-canalicular network (LCN), revealing the geometry of osteocytes in the bone matrix, can be directly visualized in 3D with submicron precision over millimetric fields of view compatible with histology. THG also reveals interfaces delineating volumes formed at successive remodeling stages. Finally, we show that the structure of the LCN can be analyzed in relation with that of the extracellular matrix and larger-scale structures by simultaneously recording THG and second-harmonic generation (SHG) signals relating to the collagen organization.},

The speciﬁc arrangement of the MCF is believed to be responsible for the optical and mechanical properties of the tusks. Especially the MCF organization likely contributes to the formation of the bright and dark checkerboard pattern observed on polished sections of tusks (Schreger pattern). Yet, the precise structural origin of this optical motif is still controversial. We hereby address this issue using complementary analytical methods (small and wide angle X-ray scattering, cross-polarized light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy) on elephant ivory samples and show that MCF orientation in ivory varies from the outer to the inner part of the tusk. An external cohesive layer of MCF with ﬁber direction perpendicular to the tusk axis wraps the mid-dentin region, where the MCF are oriented mainly along the tusk axis and arranged in a plywood-like structure with ﬁber orientations oscillating in a narrow angular range. This particular oscillating-plywood structure of the MCF and the birefringent properties of the collagen ﬁbers, likely contribute to the emergence of the Schreger pattern, one of the most intriguing macroscopic optical patterns observed in mineralized tissues and of great importance for authentication issues in archeology and forensic sciences.},

However, such characterization remains challenging since it requires combining structural analysis and imaging modalities with nanoscale precision. In this paper, we report the ﬁrst application of automated crystal orientation mapping using transmission electron microscopy (ACOM-TEM) to the structural analysis of bone mineral at the individual nanocrystal level. By controlling the nanocrystal growth of a cortical bovine bone model artiﬁcially heated up to 1000 °C, we highlight the potential of this technique. We thus show that the combination of sample mapping by scanning and the crystallographic information derived from the collected electron diffraction patterns provides a more rigorous analysis of the mineral nanostructure than standard TEM. In particular, we demonstrate that nanocrystal orientation maps yield valuable information for dimensional analysis. Furthermore, we show that ACOM-TEM has sufﬁcient sensitivity to distinguish between phases with close crystal structures and we address unresolved questions regarding the existence of a hexagonal to monoclinic phase transition induced by heating. This ﬁrst study therefore opens new perspectives in bone characterization at the nanoscale, a daunting challenge in the biomedical and archaeological ﬁelds, which could also prove particularly useful to study the mineral characteristics of tissue grown at the interface with biomaterials implants.},

In the present paper, we provide an extended investigation of the vibrational features of bone tissue in the 0.1-3 THz frequency range by time-domain THz spectroscopy. Their assignment is supported by a combination of X-ray diffraction and DFT-normal modes calculations. We investigate the effect of heating on bone tissue and synthetic calciumphosphates compounds with close structure and composition to bone mineral, including stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric hydroxyapatite (HA), tricalcium phosphate, calcium pyrophosphate and tetracalcium phosphate. We thus demonstrate that the narrow vibrational mode at 2.1 THz in bone samples exposed to thermal treatment above 750 ˚C arises from a lattice mode of stoichiometric HA. This feature is also observed in the other synthetic compounds, although weaker or broader, but is completely smeared out in the non-stoichiometric HA, close to natural bone mineral composition, or in synthetic poorly crystalline HA powder. The THz spectral range therefore provides a clear signature of the crystalline state of the investigated bone tissue and could, therefore be used to monitor or identify structural transitions occurring in bone upon heating.},

	abstract = {The increasing incidence of osteoporotic bone fractures makes fracture risk prediction an important clinical challenge. Computational models can be utilised to facilitate such analyses. However, they critically depend on bone’s underlying hierarchical material description. To understand bone’s irreversible behaviour at the micro- and nanoscale, we developed an in situ testing protocol that allows us to directly relate the experimental data to the mechanical behaviour of individual mineralised collagen ﬁbres and its main constitutive phases, the mineralised collagen ﬁbrils and the mineral nanocrystals, by combining micropillar compression of single ﬁbres with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Failure modes were assessed by SEM. Strain ratios in the elastic region at ﬁbre, ﬁbril and mineral levels were found to be approximately 22:5:2 with strain ratios at the point of compressive strength of 0.23 Æ 0.11 for ﬁbril-to-ﬁbre and 0.07 Æ 0.01 for mineral-to-ﬁbre levels. Mineral-to-ﬁbre levels showed highest strain ratios around the apparent yield point, ﬁbril-to-ﬁbre around apparent strength. The mineralised collagen ﬁbrils showed a delayed mechanical response, contrary to the mineral phase, which points towards preceding deformations of mineral nanocrystals in the extraﬁbrillar matrix. No damage was measured at the level of the mineralised collagen ﬁbre which indicates an incomplete separation of the mineral and collagen, and an extraﬁbrillar interface failure. The formation of kink bands and the gradual recruitment of ﬁbrils upon compressive loading presumably led to localised strains. Our results from a well-controlled ﬁbrillar architecture provide valuable input for micromechanical models and computational non-linear bone strength analyses that may provide further insights for personalised diagnosis and treatment as well as bio-inspired implants for patients with bone diseases.},

	abstract = {The strong dependence between cortical bone elasticity at the millimetre-scale (mesoscale) and cortical porosity has been evidenced by previous studies. However, bone is an anisotropic composite material made by mineral, proteins and water assembled in a hierarchical structure. Whether the variations of structural and compositional properties of bone affect the different elastic coefﬁcients at the mesoscale is not clear. Aiming to understand the relationships between bone elastic properties and compositions and microstructure, we applied state-of-the-art experimental modalities to assess these aspects of bone characteristics. All elastic coefﬁcients (stiffness tensor of the transverse isotropic bone material), structure of the vascular pore network, collagen and mineral properties were measured in 52 specimens from the femoral diaphysis of 26 elderly donors. Statistical analyses and micromechanical modeling showed that vascular pore volume fraction and the degree of mineralization of bone are the most important determinants of cortical bone anisotropic mesoscopic elasticity. Though signiﬁcant correlations were observed between collagen properties and elasticity, their effects in bone mesoscopic elasticity were minor in our data. This work also provides a unique set of data exhibiting a range of variations of compositional and microstructural cortical bone properties in the elderly and gives strong experimental evidence and basis for further development of biomechanical models for human cortical bone.},

	abstract = {Visualizing bone mineralization and collagen fibril organization at intermediate scales between the nanometer and the hundreds of microns range, is still an important challenge. Similarly, visualizing cellular components which locally affect the tissue structure requires a precision of a few tens of nanometers at maximum while spanning several tens of micrometers. In the last decade, gallium focused ion beam (FIB) equipped with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) proved to be an extremely valuable structural tool to meet those ends. In this study, we assess the capability of a recent plasma FIB-SEM technology which provides a potential increase in measurement speed over gallium FIB-SEM, thus paving the way to larger volume analysis. Nanometer-scale layers of demineralized and mineralized unstained human femoral lamellar bone were sequentially sectioned over volumes of 6–16,000 μm3. Analysis of mineralized tissue revealed prolate ellipsoidal mineral clusters measuring approximately 1.1 µm in length by 700 nm at their maximum diameter. Those features, suggested by others in high resolution studies, appear here as a ubiquitous motif in mineralized lamellar bone over thousands of microns cubed, suggesting a heterogeneous and yet regular pattern of mineral deposition past the single collagen fibril level. This large scale view retained sufficient resolution to visualize the collagen fibrils while also partly visualizing the lacuno-canalicular network in three-dimensions. These findings are strong evidence for suitability of PFIB as a bone analysis tool and the need to revisit bone mineralization over multi-length scales with mineralized tissue.},

	abstract = {In humans, the growth pattern of the acellular extrinsic fibre cementum (AEFC) has been useful to estimate the age-at-death. However, the structural organization behind such a pattern remains poorly understood. In this study tooth cementum from seven individuals from a Mexican modern skeletal series were analyzed with the aim of unveiling the AEFC collagenous and mineral structure using multimodal imaging approaches. The organization of collagen fibres was first determined using: light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron tomography, and plasma FIB scanning electron microscopy (PFIB-SEM) tomography. The mineral properties were then investigated using: synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) for T-parameter (correlation length between mineral particles); synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) for L-parameter (mineral crystalline domain size estimation), alignment parameter (crystals preferred orientation) and lattice parameters a and c; as well as synchrotron X-ray fluorescence for spatial distribution of calcium, phosphorus and zinc. Results show that Sharpey’s fibres branched out fibres that cover and uncover other collagen bundles forming aligned arched structures that are joined by these same fibres but in a parallel fashion. The parallel fibres are not set as a continuum on the same plane and when they are superimposed project the AEFC incremental lines due to the collagen birefringence. The orientation of the apatite crystallites is subject to the arrangement of the collagen fibres, and the obtained parameter values along with the elemental distribution maps, revealed this mineral tissue as relatively homogeneous. Therefore, no intrinsic characteristics of the mineral phase could be associated with the alternating AEFC incremental pattern.},

The autofluorescence emitted by enamel, dentin, predentin, and interglobular dentin (IGD) allows observing structural details that would otherwise require complex staining or even complementary electron microscopy or X-ray imaging. The simultaneous acquisition of autofluorescence and conventional staining fluorescence images by confocal microscope also provides important advantages to visualise occluded dentin porosity or the presence of porosity within IGD. However, autofluorescence imaging is practically limited by photobleaching. We, therefore, quantified the photobleaching extent in 3D and showed that, in confocal microscopy, the whole illuminated volume is bleached during acquisition. To mitigate this phenomenon, we analysed the photobleaching behaviour in enamel, dentin, predentin, and IGD as a function of laser power. We found that the measured decay rate cannot be modelled by a single population decay of fluorophores, highlighting the fact that autofluorescence probably arises from multiple sources. This analysis also allowed defining a laser excitation power where the photobleaching effect saturates.},

	abstract = {According to the current hydrodynamic theory, teeth sensitivity is mediated by odontoblast cell processes which can be activated by fluid flow in the pericellular space of bulk dentin. To better understand the possible spatial extent of such phenomena, we investigated the topology and connectivity of dentinal porosity of a healthy human tooth. Using confocal fluorescence microscopy, we modeled the porosity as a spatial graph with edges representing dentinal tubules or lateral branches and nodes defining their connections. A large fraction of porosity channels in crown dentin was found to be interconnected, with 47\% of nodes linked in a single component over a millimetric distance from the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ). However, significant differences in network topology were also observed. A sharp transition in connectivity from 83\% to 43\% occurred at 300 µm from the DEJ, which corresponds to an early stage of tooth formation. This was reflected in all graph metrics investigated, in particular the network resilience which dropped by a factor 2. To test the robustness of our observations, an in-depth analysis of potential remaining biases of the graph extraction was conducted. Most graph metrics considered were found to be within a 10\% precision range from a manually annotated ground truth. However, path metrics, which characterize transport properties, proved very sensitive to network defects. Residual errors were classified in 4 topological classes related to fluorescence staining and confocal detection efficiency, instrumental resolution and image processing. Their relative importance was estimated using statistical and physical graph attack simulations in a broad experimental range. Our modeling thus provides a practical framework to estimate the interpretability of calculated graph metrics for a given experimental microscopy setup and image processing pipeline. Overall, this study shows that dentin porosity exhibits typical characteristics of a complex network and quantitatively emphasize the importance of the smallest lateral branches. Our results could be used to model fluid flow more accurately in order to better understand mechanosensing by odontoblasts in dentin.},

We find that the mineralized collagen fibrils spiral around the central axis with varying degrees of tilt, which would — structurally — impart high extensibility to the osteon.

	abstract = {X-rays interact strongly with biological organisms. Synchrotron radiation sources deliver very intense Xray photon ﬂuxes within micro- or submicro cross-section beams, resulting in doses larger than the MGy. The relevance of synchrotron radiation analyses of biological materials is therefore questionable since such doses, million times higher than the ones used in radiotherapy, can cause huge damages in tissues, with regard to not only DNA, but also proteic and lipid organizations. Very few data concerning the effect of very high X-ray doses in tissues are available in the literature. We present here an analysis of the structural phenomena which occur when the model tissue of human hair is irradiated by a synchrotron X-ray micro-beam. The choice of hair is supported by its hierarchical and partially ordered keratin structure which can be analysed inside the tissue by X-ray diffraction. To assess the damages caused by hard Xray micro-beams (1 lm2 cross-section), short exposure time scattering SAXS/WAXS patterns have been recorded at beamline ID13 (ESRF) after various irradiation times. Various modiﬁcations of the scattering patterns are observed, they provide ﬁne insight of the radiation damages at various hierarchical levels and also unexpectedly provide information about the stability of the various hierarchical structural levels. It appears that the molecular level, i.e. the alpha helices which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds and the alpha-helical coiled coils which are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, is more sensitive to radiation than the supramolecular architecture of the keratin ﬁlament and the ﬁlament packing within the keratin associated proteins matrix, which is stabilized by disulphide bonds.},

The composite nature of biological materials at the nanoscale combined with an important structural hierarchy up to the macroscopic level is responsible for these exceptional properties. In this chapter we discuss the relation of the structural features of different biological materials within their archaeological and historical contexts along with their anthropological use and function. Amid the wealth of biological materials of archaeological interest, a special attention is paid to carbonate–based materials such as corals and shells and phosphate-based ones, including bone, teeth, ivory and antler. The structural features of these archaeobiominerals at different length scales down to the nanoscopic scale are highlighted in this chapter as they allow drawing conclusions on ancient working techniques, the provision and circulation of raw materials, anthropological heat processes, and, last but not least, on diagenetic changes and authentication purposes. The informative potential of observations of archaeological biological materials at different length scales is ﬁnally illustrated by some case studies.},

The lacuno-canalicular network (LCN) hosting the osteocytes in the bone matrix, in particular, represents a biological signature of the mechanotransduction activity in response to external biomechanical loading. We have demonstrated that label-free third-harmonic generation (THG) microscopy reveals the structure of the LCN in 3D with submicron precision over millimetric fields of view compatible with histology and can be coupled to second-harmonic generation (SHG) signals relating to the collagen organization in the bone matrix. Taking advantage of these label-free imaging methods, we investigate the impact of microgravity on the LCN structure in mice following a 1month space flight. We show that our current lack of understanding of the extent of the LCN heterogeneity at the organ level hinders the interpretation of such investigations based on a limited number of samples and we discuss the implications for future biomedical studies.},

The systematic mapping of the perturbed zone allows spatially dependant structural changes to be determined. Similar experiments for a Vectra single ﬁber show a partial transformation of the pseudohexagonal phase into the orthorhombic phase. In situ experiments allow following structural changes as a function of time and applied force. During indentation of an iPP ﬁber, domain doubling during indentation and single domain recovery after the tip has been retracted is observed.},

The goal of this study was to assess the relationship of osteon level impedance variation to the orientation and size of mineral (hydroxyapatite) platelet at one micron resolution. Methods : Data were acquired on a human femoral cross-section using 900-MHz SAM, synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR-ȝCT to measure the local variation of HA content) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). SAXS provides the relative variation of HA platelet orientation and changes in mean thickness from the analysis of the integrated SAXS intensity and pattern, respectively. Results : While SR-ȝCT images showed a constant level of mineral, both SAM and SAXS images displayed the lamellar level modulation related to the modulation of microelasticity, orientation and thickness of the platelets. Z was strongly correlated with the SAXS intensity (R2=0.91, p{\textless}0.0001) but much lower correlated with the platelets thickness (R2=0.35, p{\textless}0.0001). Conclusions : Our study is the first one that combines SAXS, SR-ȝCT and SAM to elucidate the impact of mineral platelets orientation and mean thickness on microelasticity. Our results suggest that the main factor contributing to microelasticity variations is the platelet orientation reflected in modulations of the integrated SAXS intensity.},

	abstract = {The complex structure of bone requires a structural description of the material at different hierarchical levels. At the micrometer level, collagen fibril orientation and osteocyte network architecture can be described by different light microscopy methods. However, further investigation of the nanostructure of bone requires high-resolution techniques such as electron microscopy as well as x-ray scattering methods. The basic building blocks at the nanometer level are organic type I collagen fibrils reinforced by nanoparticles of carbonated apatite mineral. Most commonly, these fibrils aggregate into lamellae of about 5 µm width, in both compact and spongy bone. The architecture of the mineral platelets and the collagen fibrils influences the mechanical properties. Models of twisted and rotated plywood motifs have been proposed, although detailed quantitative characterization at length scales comparable to typical tissue unit sizes are still lacking. Here, we describe a scanning small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) method to reconstruct the variation of the three-dimensional habit of mineral platelets within osteonal bone. We find that the platelets change their orientation at micrometer resolution and are organized structurally by a repeating unit of about 5 µm, which is in agreement with previous wide-angle x-ray diffraction microtexture measurements. At the spatial resolution of the microbeam used (1 µm), we observe fiber geometry. The presented SAXS reconstruction technique could also be applied to the analysis of nanoparticle orientation in highly textured biomaterials.},

The new methodological developments concerning the study of the morphological and structural features of archaeological bones at micro- and nanoscale are emphasized in order to elucidate fine diagenetic modifications and to better understand the underlying alteration mechanisms. A combination of synchrotron X-ray microtomography, infrared micro-spectroscopy imaging and quantitative scanning small-angle X-ray scattering (sSAXS) imaging allowed studying micromorphological changes and the distribution of the organic and mineral components of bone at a histological level. Transmission electron microscopy gives precise information on changes of apatite crystal dimensions, orientations, periodicity of collagen fiber arrangement and crystal distributions within the fibers in archaeological bone. It allows establishing criteria to evaluate more precisely the preservation state of archaeological bone material with respect to modern references. The potential of these methods is highlighted on the basis of the study of some macroscopically well preserved archaeological bone samples from the Chalain lake station 19, Neolithic period, Jura, France. The investigations allowed a differentiation in preservation state between these samples and the postulation of an alteration sequence in such humid chalk-rich burial environments.},
